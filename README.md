## Spring MVC C.R.U.D. Project

### Overview
This is a C.R.U.D. (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) application made from scratch that retrieves information from a database that I created using MySQLWorkbench. The application follows the MVC pattern which includes the model, the view, and the controller.

My specific project consists of the user being able to add, remove, or update a cat at a cat cafe.

### Technologies Used

### Lessons Learned

- Learned more about Spring framework and also the MVC framework as it applies to a C.R.U.D. application.

- Learned how to mimic the functionality of a database and excited to expand upon this project and add additional tables to the mix.


### Future Goals

- Add location data with Google Maps reference for which cat cafe each cat is housed.

- Add images of each cat when they are listed out and allow a user to add or update an image of the cat.
